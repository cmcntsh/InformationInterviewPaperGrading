# Informational Interview Paper Grading

This is a set of resources for evaluating student writing for the informational interview paper. https://utah.instructure.com/courses/934121/assignments/13311169 It is broken down by main sections of the paper.

* General writing advice https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents
* Highlighting and feedback conventions https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents#highlighting
* At a minimum, I would strongly encourage students to run the copyediting prompt before submitting their work. It would be nice if they would also run the substantive editing prompt and address any gaps before submitting. It would also be nice if they would review their paragraphs for strong main topics and suitable organization.
